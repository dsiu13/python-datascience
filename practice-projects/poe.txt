From childhood's hour I have not been
As others were  I have not seen
As others saw  I could not bring
My passions from a common spring
From the same source I have not taken
My sorrow  I could not awaken
My heart to joy at the same tone
And all I lov'd  I lov'd alone
Then  in my childhood  in the dawn
Of a most stormy life  was drawn
From ev'ry depth of good and ill
The mystery which binds me still
From the torrent or the fountain
From the red cliff of the mountain
From the sun that 'round me roll'd
In its autumn tint of gold
From the lightning in the sky
As it pass'd me flying by
From the thunder and the storm
And the cloud that took the form
 When the rest of Heaven was blue
Of a demon in my view

It was many and many a year ago
In a kingdom by the sea
That a maiden there lived whom you may know
By the name of ANNABEL LEE
And this maiden she lived with no other thought
Than to love and be loved by me.
She was a child and I was a child
In this kingdom by the sea
But we loved with a love that was more than love
I and my Annabel Lee
With a love that the winged seraphs of heaven
Coveted her and me.

And this was the reason that long ago
In this kingdom by the sea
A wind blew out of a cloud by night
Chilling my Annabel Lee
So that her high  born kinsman came
And bore her away from me
To shut her up in a sepulchre
In this kingdom by the sea.

The angels not half so happy in Heaven
Went envying her and me
Yes that was the reason as all men know
In this kingdom by the sea
That the wind came out of a cloud chilling
And killing my Annabel Lee.

But our love it was stronger by far than the love
Of those who were older than we
Of many far wiser than we
And neither the angels in Heaven above
Nor the demons down under the sea
Can ever dissever my soul from the soul
Of the beautiful Annabel Lee

For the moon never beams without bringing me dreams
Of the beautiful Annabel Lee
And the stars never rise but I see the bright eyes
Of the beautiful Annabel Lee
And so all the night  tide I lie down by the side
Of my darling my darling my life and my bride
In her sepulchre there by the sea
In her tomb by the side of the sea.


HEAR the sledges with the bells
Silver bells
What a world of merriment their melody foretells
How they tinkle tinkle tinkle
In the icy air of night
While the stars that oversprinkle
All the heavens seem to twinkle
With a crystalline delight
Keeping time time time
In a sort of Runic rhyme
To the tintinnabulation that so musically wells
From the bells bells bells bells
Bells bells bells
From the jingling and the tinkling of the bells.


Hear the mellow wedding bells
Golden bells
What a world of happiness their harmony foretells
Through the balmy air of night
How they ring out their delight
From the molten  golden notes
And all in tune
What a liquid ditty floats
To the turtle  dove that listens while she gloats
On the moon
Oh from out the sounding cells
What a gush of euphony voluminously wells
How it swells
How it dwells
On the Future  how it tells
Of the rapture that impels
To the swinging and the ringing
Of the bells bells bells
Of the bells bells bells bells
Bells bells bells
To the rhyming and the chiming of the bells


Hear the loud alarum bells
Brazen bells
What tale of terror now their turbulency tells
In the startled ear of night
How they scream out their affright
Too much horrified to speak
They can only shriek shriek
Out of tune
In a clamorous appealing to the mercy of the fire
In a mad expostulation with the deaf and frantic fire
Leaping higher higher higher
With a desperate desire
And a resolute endeavor
Now  now to sit or never
By the side of the pale  faced moon.
Oh the bells bells bells
What a tale their terror tells
Of Despair
How they clang and clash and roar
What a horror they outpour
On the bosom of the palpitating air
Yet the ear it fully knows
By the twanging
And the clanging
How the danger ebbs and flows
Yet the ear distinctly tells
In the jangling
How the danger sinks and swells
By the sinking or the swelling in the anger of the bells
Of the bells
Of the bells bells bells bells
Bells bells bells
In the clamour and the clangour of the bells

Hear the tolling of the bells
Iron bells
What a world of solemn thought their monody compels
In the silence of the night
How we shiver with affright
At the melancholy meaning of their tone
For every sound that floats
From the rust within their throats
Is a groan.
And the people  ah the people
They that dwell up in the steeple
All alone
And who tolling tolling tolling
In that muffled monotone
Feel a glory in so rolling
On the human heart a stone
They are neither man nor woman
They are neither brute nor human
They are Ghouls
And their king it is who tolls
And he rolls rolls rolls rolls
Rolls

A paean from the bells
And his merry bosom swells
With the paean of the bells
And he dances and he yells
Keeping time time time
In a sort of Runic rhyme
To the paean of the bells
Of the bells
Keeping time time time
In a sort of Runic rhyme
To the throbbing of the bells
Of the bells bells bells
To the sobbing of the bells
Keeping time time time
As he knells knells knells
In a happy Runic rhyme
To the rolling of the bells
Of the bells bells bells
To the tolling of the bells
Of the bells bells bells bells
Bells bells bells
To the moaning and the groaning of the bells.

Lo Death has reared himself a throne
In a strange city lying alone
Far down within the dim West
Where the good and the bad and the worst and the best
Have gone to their eternal rest.
There shrines and palaces and towers
 Time  eaten towers that tremble not
Resemble nothing that is ours.
Around by lifting winds forgot
Resignedly beneath the sky
The melancholy waters lie.
No rays from the holy heaven come down
On the long night  time of that town
But light from out the lurid sea
Streams up the turrets silently
Gleams up the pinnacles far and free
Up domes   up spires   up kingly halls
Up fanes   up Babylon  like walls
Up shadowy long  forgotten bowers
Of sculptured ivy and stone flowers
Up many and many a marvellous shrine
Whose wreathed friezes intertwine
The viol the violet and the vine.
Resignedly beneath the sky
The melancholy waters lie.
So blend the turrets and shadows there
That all seem pendulous in air
While from a proud tower in the town
Death looks gigantically down.

There open fanes and gaping graves
Yawn level with the luminous waves
But not the riches there that lie
In each idol's diamond eye
Not the gaily  jewelled dead
Tempt the waters from their bed
For no ripples curl alas
Along that wilderness of glass
No swellings tell that winds may be
Upon some far  off happier sea
No heavings hint that winds have been
On seas less hideously serene.

But lo a stir is in the air
The wave   there is a movement there
As if the towers had thrust aside
In slightly sinking the dull tide
As if their tops had feebly given
A void within the filmy Heaven.
The waves have now a redder glow
The hours are breathing faint and low
And when amid no earthly moans
Down down that town shall settle hence
Hell rising from a thousand thrones
Shall do it reverence.

Lo 'tis a gala night
Within the lonesome latter years
An angel throng bewinged bedight
In veils and drowned in tears
Sit in a theatre to see
A play of hopes and fears
While the orchestra breathes fitfully
The music of the spheres.
Mimes in the form of God on high
Mutter and mumble low
And hither and thither fly
Mere puppets they who come and go
At bidding of vast formless things
That shift the scenery to and fro
Flapping from out their Condor wings
Invisible Woe

That motley drama   oh be sure
It shall not be forgot
With its Phantom chased for evermore
By a crowd that seize it not
Through a circle that ever returneth in
To the self  same spot
And much of Madness and more of Sin
And Horror the soul of the plot.

But see amid the mimic rout
A crawling shape intrude
A blood  red thing that writhes from out
The scenic solitude
It writhes    it writhes    with mortal pangs
The mimes become its food
And seraphs sob at vermin fangs
In human gore imbued.

Out   out are the lights   out all
And over each quivering form
The curtain a funeral pall
Comes down with the rush of a storm
While the angels all pallid and wan
Uprising unveiling affirm
That the play is the tragedy "Man "
And its hero the Conqueror Worm.

By a route obscure and lonely
Haunted by ill angels only
Where an Eidolon named NIGHT
On a black throne reigns upright
I have reached these lands but newly
From an ultimate dim Thule
From a wild weird clime that lieth sublime
Out of SPACE  out of TIME.

Bottomless vales and boundless floods
And chasms and caves and Titan woods
With forms that no man can discover
For the dews that drip all over
Mountains toppling evermore
Into seas without a shore
Seas that restlessly aspire
Surging unto skies of fire
Lakes that endlessly outspread
Their lone waters  lone and dead
Their still waters  still and chilly
With the snows of the lolling lily.

By the lakes that thus outspread
Their lone waters lone and dead
Their sad waters sad and chilly
With the snows of the lolling lily
By the mountains  near the river
Murmuring lowly murmuring ever
By the grey woods   by the swamp
Where the toad and the newt encamp
By the dismal tarns and pools
Where dwell the Ghouls
By each spot the most unholy
In each nook most melancholy
There the traveller meets aghast
Sheeted Memories of the Past
Shrouded forms that start and sigh
As they pass the wanderer by
White  robed forms of friends long given
In agony to the Earth  and Heaven.

For the heart whose woes are legion
'Tis a peaceful soothing region
For the spirit that walks in shadow
'Tis  oh 'tis an Eldorado
But the traveller travelling through it
May not  dare not openly view it
Never its mysteries are exposed
To the weak human eye unclosed
So wills its King who hath forbid
The uplifting of the fringed lid
And thus the sad Soul that here passes
Beholds it but through darkened glasses.

By a route obscure and lonely
Haunted by ill angels only
Where an Eidolon named NIGHT
On a black throne reigns upright
I have wandered home but newly
From this ultimate dim Thule.
Take this kiss upon the brow
And in parting from you now
Thus much let me avow
You are not wrong who deem
That my days have been a dream
Yet if hope has flown away
In a night or in a day
In a vision or in none
Is it therefore the less gone?
All that we see or seem
Is but a dream within a dream.

I stand amid the roar
Of a surf  tormented shore
And I hold within my hand
Grains of the golden sand
How few yet how they creep
Through my fingers to the deep
While I weep  while I weep
O God can I not grasp
Them with a tighter clasp?
O God can I not save
One from the pitiless wave?
Is all that we see or seem
But a dream within a dream?

GAILY bedight
A gallant knight
In sunshine and in shadow
Had journeyed long
Singing a song
In search of Eldorado.

But he grew old
This knight so bold
And o'er his heart a shadow
Fell as he found
No spot of ground
That looked like Eldorado.

And as his strength
Failed him at length
He met a pilgrim shadow
"Shadow " said he
"Where can it be
This land of Eldorado?"

"Over the Mountains
Of the Moon
Down the Valley of the Shadow
Ride boldly ride "
The shade replied
"If you seek for Eldorado "

Thank Heaven the crisis
The danger is past
And the lingering illness
Is over at last
And the fever called "Living"
Is conquered at last.

Sadly I know
I am shorn of my strength
And no muscle I move
As I lie at full length
But no matter   I feel
I am better at length.

And I rest so composedly
Now in my bed
That any beholder
Might fancy me dead
Might start at beholding me
Thinking me dead.

The moaning and groaning
The sighing and sobbing
Are quieted now
With that horrible throbbing
At heart    ah that horrible
Horrible throbbing

The sickness  the nausea
The pitiless pain
Have ceased with the fever
That maddened my brain
With the fever called "Living"
That burned in my brain.

And oh of all tortures
That torture the worst
Has abated  the terrible
Torture of thirst
For the naphthaline river
Of Passion accurst
I have drank of a water
That quenches all thirst

Of a water that flows
With a lullaby sound
From a spring but a very few
Feet under ground
From a cavern not very far
Down under ground.

And ah let it never
Be foolishly said
That my room it is gloomy
And narrow my bed
For man never slept
In a different bed
And to sleep you must slumber
In just such a bed.

My tantalized spirit
Here blandly reposes
Forgetting or never
Regretting its roses
Its old agitations
Of myrtles and roses

For now while so quietly
Lying it fancies
A holier odor
About it of pansies
A rosemary odor
Commingled with pansies
With rue and the beautiful
Puritan pansies.

And so it lies happily
Bathing in many
A dream of the truth
And the beauty of Annie
Drowned in a bath
Of the tresses of Annie.

She tenderly kissed me
She fondly caressed
And then I fell gently
To sleep on her breast
Deeply to sleep
From the heaven of her breast.

When the light was extinguished
She covered me warm
And she prayed to the angels
To keep me from harm
To the queen of the angels
To shield me from harm.

And I lie so composedly
Now in my bed
 Knowing her love
That you fancy me dead
And I rest so contentedly
Now in my bed
 With her love at my breast
That you fancy me dead
That you shudder to look at me
Thinking me dead

But my heart it is brighter
Than all of the many
Stars in the sky
For it sparkles with Annie
It glows with the light
Of the love of my Annie
With the thought of the light
Of the eyes of my Annie.

In the greenest of our valleys
By good angels tenanted
Once a fair and stately palace
Radiant palace   reared its head.
In the monarch Thought's dominion
It stood there
Never seraph spread a pinion
Over fabric half so fair
Banners yellow glorious golden
On its roof did float and flow
This   all this   was in the olden
Time long ago
And every gentle air that dallied
In that sweet day
Along the ramparts plumed and pallid
A winged odor went away.

Wanderers in that happy valley
Through two luminous windows saw
Spirits moving musically
To a lute's well  tuned law
Round about a throne where sitting
Porphyrogene
In state his glory well  befitting
The ruler of the realm was seen.

And all with pearl and ruby glowing
Was the fair palace door
Through which came flowing flowing flowing
And sparkling evermore
A troop of Echoes whose sweet duty
Was but to sing
In voices of surpassing beauty
The wit and wisdom of their king.

But evil things in robes of sorrow
Assailed the monarch's high estate.
Ah let us mourn    for never morrow
Shall dawn upon him desolate
And round about his home the glory
That blushed and bloomed
Is but a dim  remembered story
Of the old time entombed.

And travellers now within that valley
Through the red  litten windows see
Vast forms that move fantastically
To a discordant melody
While like a ghastly rapid river
Through the pale door
A hideous throng rush out forever
And laugh   but smile no more.

Once upon a midnight dreary while I pondered weak and weary
Over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore
While I nodded nearly napping suddenly there came a tapping
As of some one gently rapping rapping at my chamber door.
"'Tis some visitor " I muttered "tapping at my chamber door
Only this and nothing more."

Ah distinctly I remember it was in the bleak December
And each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor.
Eagerly I wished the morrow    vainly I had sought to borrow
From my books surcease of sorrow   sorrow for the lost Lenore
For the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore
Nameless here for evermore.

And the silken sad uncertain rustling of each purple curtain
Thrilled me   filled me with fantastic terrors never felt before
So that now to still the beating of my heart I stood repeating
"'Tis some visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door
Some late visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door
This it is and nothing more."

Presently my soul grew stronger hesitating then no longer
"Sir " said I "or Madam truly your forgiveness I implore
But the fact is I was napping and so gently you came rapping
And so faintly you came tapping tapping at my chamber door
That I scarce was sure I heard you"   here I opened wide the door
Darkness there and nothing more.

Deep into that darkness peering long I stood there wondering fearing
Doubting dreaming dreams no mortal ever dared to dream before
But the silence was unbroken and the stillness gave no token
And the only word there spoken was the whispered word "Lenore?"
This I whispered and an echo murmured back the word "Lenore "
Merely this and nothing more.

Back into the chamber turning all my soul within me burning
Soon again I heard a tapping somewhat louder than before.
"Surely " said I "surely that is something at my window lattice
Let me see then what thereat is and this mystery explore
Let my heart be still a moment and this mystery explore
'Tis the wind and nothing more "

Open here I flung the shutter when with many a flirt and flutter
In there stepped a stately Raven of the saintly days of yore
Not the least obeisance made he not a minute stopped or stayed he
But with mien of lord or lady perched above my chamber door
Perched upon a bust of Pallas just above my chamber door
Perched and sat and nothing more.

Then this ebony bird beguiling my sad fancy into smiling
By the grave and stern decorum of the countenance it wore.
"Though thy crest be shorn and shaven thou " I said "art sure no craven
Ghastly grim and ancient Raven wandering from the Nightly shore
Tell me what thy lordly name is on the Night's Plutonian shore "
Quoth the Raven "Nevermore."

Much I marvelled this ungainly fowl to hear discourse so plainly
Though its answer little meaning   little relevancy bore
For we cannot help agreeing that no living human being
Ever yet was blessed with seeing bird above his chamber door
Bird or beast upon the sculptured bust above his chamber door
With such name as "Nevermore."

But the Raven sitting lonely on the placid bust spoke only
That one word as if his soul in that one word he did outpour.
Nothing further then he uttered   not a feather then he fluttered
Till I scarcely more than muttered "Other friends have flown before
On the morrow he will leave me as my hopes have flown before."
Then the bird said "Nevermore."

Startled at the stillness broken by reply so aptly spoken
"Doubtless " said I "what it utters is its only stock and store
Caught from some unhappy master whom unmerciful Disaster
Followed fast and followed faster till his songs one burden bore
Till the dirges of his Hope that melancholy burden bore
Of 'Never   nevermore'."

But the Raven still beguiling all my fancy into smiling
Straight I wheeled a cushioned seat in front of bird and bust and door
Then upon the velvet sinking I betook myself to linking
Fancy unto fancy thinking what this ominous bird of yore
What this grim ungainly ghastly gaunt and ominous bird of yore
Meant in croaking "Nevermore."

This I sat engaged in guessing but no syllable expressing
To the fowl whose fiery eyes now burned into my bosom's core
This and more I sat divining with my head at ease reclining
On the cushion's velvet lining that the lamp  light gloated o'er
But whose velvet violet lining with the lamp  light gloating o'er
She shall press ah nevermore

Then methought the air grew denser perfumed from an unseen censer
Swung by Seraphim whose footfalls tinkled on the tufted floor.
"Wretch " I cried "thy God hath lent thee   by these angels he hath sent thee
Respite   respite and nepenthe from thy memories of Lenore
Quaff oh quaff this kind nepenthe and forget this lost Lenore "
Quoth the Raven "Nevermore."

"Prophet " said I "thing of evil    prophet still if bird or devil
Whether Tempter sent or whether tempest tossed thee here ashore
Desolate yet all undaunted on this desert land enchanted
On this home by Horror haunted   tell me truly I implore
Is there   is there balm in Gilead?   tell me   tell me I implore "
Quoth the Raven "Nevermore."

"Prophet " said I "thing of evil    prophet still if bird or devil
By that Heaven that bends above us   by that God we both adore
Tell this soul with sorrow laden if within the distant Aidenn
It shall clasp a sainted maiden whom the angels name Lenore
Clasp a rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore."
Quoth the Raven "Nevermore."

"Be that word our sign in parting bird or fiend " I shrieked upstarting
"Get thee back into the tempest and the Night's Plutonian shore
Leave no black plume as a token of that lie thy soul hath spoken
Leave my loneliness unbroken    quit the bust above my door
Take thy beak from out my heart and take thy form from off my door "
Quoth the Raven "Nevermore."

And the Raven never flitting still is sitting still is sitting
On the pallid bust of Pallas just above my chamber door
And his eyes have all the seeming of a demon's that is dreaming
And the lamp  light o'er him streaming throws his shadow on the floor
And my soul from out that shadow that lies floating on the floor
Shall be lifted   nevermore

At midnight in the month of June
I stand beneath the mystic moon.
An opiate vapor dewy dim
Exhales from out her golden rim
And softly dripping drop by drop
Upon the quiet mountain top
Steals drowsily and musically
Into the universal valley.
The rosemary nods upon the grave
The lily lolls upon the wave
Wrapping the fog about its breast
The ruin molders into rest
Looking like Lethe see the lake
A conscious slumber seems to take
And would not for the world awake.
All Beauty sleeps    and lo where lies
Irene with her Destinies

O lady bright can it be right
This window open to the night?
The wanton airs from the tree  top
Laughingly through the lattice drop
The bodiless airs a wizard rout
Flit through thy chamber in and out
And wave the curtain canopy
So fitfully   so fearfully
Above the closed and fringed lid
'Neath which thy slumb'ring soul lies hid
That o'er the floor and down the wall
Like ghosts the shadows rise and fall
Oh lady dear hast thou no fear?
Why and what art thou dreaming here?
Sure thou art come O'er far  off seas
A wonder to these garden trees
Strange is thy pallor strange thy dress
Strange above all thy length of tress
And this all solemn silentness

The lady sleeps Oh may her sleep
Which is enduring so be deep
Heaven have her in its sacred keep
This chamber changed for one more holy
This bed for one more melancholy
I pray to God that she may lie
For ever with unopened eye
While the pale sheeted ghosts go by

My love she sleeps Oh may her sleep
As it is lasting so be deep
Soft may the worms about her creep
Far in the forest dim and old
For her may some tall vault unfold
Some vault that oft has flung its black
And winged panels fluttering back
Triumphant o'er the crested palls
Of her grand family funerals

Some sepulchre remote alone
Against whose portal she hath thrown
In childhood many an idle stone
Some tomb from out whose sounding door
She ne'er shall force an echo more
Thrilling to think poor child of sin
It was the dead who groaned within.

Fair river in thy bright clear flow
Of crystal wandering water
Thou art an emblem of the glow
Of beauty  the unhidden heart
The playful maziness of art
In old Alberto's daughter

But when within thy wave she looks
Which glistens then and trembles
Why then the prettiest of brooks
Her worshipper resembles
For in my heart as in thy stream
Her image deeply lies
The heart which trembles at the beam
Of her soul  searching eyes.

For her this rhyme is penned whose luminous eyes
Brightly expressive as the twins of L�da
Shall find her own sweet name that nestling lies
Upon the page enwrapped from every reader.
Search narrowly the lines   they hold a treasure
Divine  a talisman  an amulet
That must be worn at heart. Search well the measure
The words  the syllables Do not forget
The trivialest point or you may lose your labor
And yet there is in this no Gordian knot
Which one might not undo without a sabre
If one could merely comprehend the plot.
Enwritten upon the leaf where now are peering
Eyes scintillating soul there lie perdus
Three eloquent words oft uttered in the hearing
Of poets by poets  as the name is a poet�s too.
Its letters although naturally lying
Like the knight Pinto  Mendez Ferdinando
Still form a synonym for Truth.  Cease trying
You will not read the riddle though you do the best you can do.

Once it smiled a silent dell
Where the people did not dwell
They had gone unto the wars
Trusting to the mild  eyed stars
Nightly from their azure towers
To keep watch above the flowers
In the midst of which all day
The red sun  light lazily lay.
Now each visitor shall confess
The sad valley's restlessness.
Nothing there is motionless
Nothing save the airs that brood
Over the magic solitude.
Ah by no wind are stirred those trees
That palpitate like the chill seas
Around the misty Hebrides
Ah by no wind those clouds are driven
That rustle through the unquiet Heaven
Uneasily from morn till even
Over the violets there that lie
In myriad types of the human eye
Over the lilies there that wave
And weep above a nameless grave
They wave    from out their fragrant tops
Eternal dews come down in drops.
They weep    from off their delicate stems
Perennial tears descend in gems.

Thy soul shall find itself alone
'Mid dark thoughts of the grey tomb  stone
Not one of all the crowd to pry
Into thine hour of secrecy
Be silent in that solitude
Which is not loneliness  for then
The spirits of the dead who stood
In life before thee are again
In death around thee  and their will
Shall then overshadow thee  be still.

For the night  tho' clear  shall frown
And the stars shall look not down
From their high thrones in the Heaven
With light like Hope to mortals given
But their red orbs without beam
To thy weariness shall seem
As a burning and a fever
Which would cling to thee for ever

Now are thoughts thou shalt not banish
Now are visions ne'er to vanish
From thy spirit shall they pass
No more  like dew  drop from the grass

The breeze  the breath of God  is still
And the mist upon the hill
Shadowy  shadowy  yet unbroken
Is a symbol and a token
How it hangs upon the trees
A mystery of mysteries
